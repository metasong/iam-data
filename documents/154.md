* Engine: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JavaScript program.

* Compiler: one of Engine's friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation.

* Scope: another friend of Engine; collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

`var a = 2;`

The first thing Compiler will do with this program is perform lexing to break it down into tokens, which it will then parse into a tree.

Encountering `var a`, Compiler asks Scope to see if a variable a already exists for that particular scope collection. If so, Compiler ignores this declaration and moves on. Otherwise, Compiler asks Scope to declare a new variable called a for that scope collection.

Compiler then produces code for Engine to later execute, to handle the a = 2 assignment. The code Engine runs will first ask Scope if there is a variable called a accessible in the current scope collection. If so, Engine uses that variable. If not, Engine looks elsewhere.If Engine eventually finds a variable, it assigns the value 2 to it. If not, Engine will raise its hand and yell out an error!

> **Note:** LHS and RHS meaning "left/right-hand side of an assignment" doesn't necessarily literally mean "left/right side of the = assignment operator". There are several other ways that assignments happen, and so it's better to conceptually think about it as: "who's the target of the assignment (LHS)" and "who's the source of the assignment (RHS)".
> i.e. `a++'

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}
// conversation start
foo( 2 );
```

> Engine: Hey Scope, I have an RHS reference for foo. Ever heard of it?

> Scope: yes, I have. Compiler declared it just a second ago. He's a function. Here you go.

> Engine: Great, thanks! OK, I'm executing foo.

> Engine: Hey, Scope, I've got an LHS reference for a, ever heard of it?

> Scope: yes, I have. Compiler declared it as a formal parameter to foo just recently. Here you go.

>Engine: Helpful as always, Scope. Thanks again. Now, time to assign 2 to a.

> Engine: Hey, Scope, sorry to bother you again. I need an RHS look-up for console. Ever heard of it?

> Scope: No problem, Engine, this is what I do all day. Yes, I've got console. He's built-in. Here ya go.

> Engine: Perfect. Looking up log(..). OK, great, it's a function.

> Engine: Yo, Scope. Can you help me out with an RHS reference to a. I think I remember it, but just want to double-check.

> Scope: You're right, Engine. Same guy, hasn't changed. Here ya go.

> Engine: Cool. Passing the value of a, which is 2, into log(..).

## Nested Scope

Scope is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked-up. This look-up may be for the purposes of assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (left-hand-side) reference, or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS (right-hand-side) reference.

LHS references result from assignment operations. Scope-related assignments can occur either with the = operator or by passing arguments to (assign to) function parameters. Just as a block or function is nested inside another block or function, scopes are nested inside other scopes. Engine starts at the currently executing Scope, looks for the variable there, then if not found, keeps going up one level, and so on. If the outermost global scope is reached, the search stops, whether it finds the variable or not.Unfulfilled RHS references result in ReferenceErrors being thrown. Unfulfilled LHS references result in an automatic, implicitly-created global of that name (if not in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]), or a ReferenceError (if in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]).

in js scope is lexical scope:
lexical scope is scope that is defined at lexing time. In other words, lexical scope is based on where variables and blocks of scope are authored, by you, at write time, and thus is (mostly) set in stone by the time the lexer processes your code.

> **Note**: We will see in a little bit there are some ways to cheat lexical scope, thereby modifying it after the lexer has passed by, but these are frowned upon. It is considered best practice to treat lexical scope as, in fact, lexical-only, and thus entirely author-time in nature.

```js
function foo(a) {

	var b = a * 2;

	function bar(c) {
		console.log( a, b, c );
	}

	bar(b * 3);
}

foo( 2 ); // 2 4 12
```

Bubble 1 encompasses the global scope, and has just one identifier in it: foo.

Bubble 2 encompasses the scope of foo, which includes the three identifiers: a, bar and b.

Bubble 3 encompasses the scope of bar, and it includes just one identifier: c.

>Note: Global variables are also automatically properties of the global object (window in browsers, etc.), so it is possible to reference a global variable not directly by its lexical name, but instead indirectly as a property reference of the global object.

`window.a`
This technique gives access to a global variable which would otherwise be inaccessible due to it being shadowed. However, non-global shadowed variables cannot be accessed.

## scope is defined at compile time/not runtime

stack is runtime object, so not used for scope.
```js
let x = 10;

function func1(){
   console.log(x);
}

function func2() {
  let x = 20; // here x is not referenced by any inner function (not defined), is a pure stack variable
  func1();
}

func2(); // 10 not the value on parent function stack
```

> A closure is a function which has access to it's parent's variables even after the outer function has returned. In other words, a closure has three scopes:
* Local Scope - Access to variables in its own scope
* Parent Function's scope - Access to variables within its parent
* Global Scope - Access to global variables

> even after the outer function ceases to exist, the inner function has access to the variables defined in the scope of the outer function.  closure not using stack, because the outer function stack already popup.

> This concept of scope object is very different from, say, C or C++, where local variables are stored on stack. In JavaScript, scope objects are allocated in heap instead (or at least they behave like this), so they might stay allocated even if function already returned. 

if you try to access some non-existing property of regular object, and prototype chain doesn't contain this property either, it's not an error: undefined is silently returned. But if you try to access non-existing property on the scope chain (i.e. access non-existing variable), then ReferenceError occurs.
```js
"use strict";
var foo = 1;
var bar = 2;
 
function myFunc() {
  //-- define local-to-function variables
  var a = 1;
  var b = 2;
  var foo = 3;
 
  console.log("inside myFunc");
}
 
console.log("outside");
 
//-- and then, call it:
myFunc();

```

```js
function outer() {
    let x = 3
    return function inner(y) {
        return x*y
    }
}

let multiplyByThree = outer();

console.log(multiplyByThree(2)); //6
```

### look at the closure
```js
console.dir(multiplyByThree);

```js
const balance = (function() {
    let privateBalance = 0;

    return {
        increment: function(value){
            privateBalance += value;
            return privateBalance;
        },
        decrement: function(value){
            privateBalance -= value;
            return privateBalance;
        },
        show: function(){
            return privateBalance;
        }
    }
})()

console.log(balance.show()); // 0
console.log(balance.increment(500)); // 500
console.log(balance.decrement(200)); // 300
```

## Cheating Lexical

cheating lexical scope leads to poorer performance.

```js
function foo(str, a) {
	eval( str ); // cheating!
	console.log( a, b );
}

var b = 2;

foo( "var b = 3;", 1 ); // 1 3
```
> Note: eval(..) when used in a strict-mode program operates in its own lexical scope, which means declarations made inside of the eval() do not actually modify the enclosing scope.
```js
function foo(str) {
   "use strict";
   eval( str );
   console.log( a ); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
}

foo( "var a = 2" );
```

### with

```js
var obj = {
	a: 1,
	b: 2,
	c: 3
};

// more "tedious" to repeat "obj"
obj.a = 2;
obj.b = 3;
obj.c = 4;

// "easier" short-hand
with (obj) {
	a = 3;
	b = 4;
	c = 5;
}

function foo(obj) {
	with (obj) {
		a = 2;
	}
}

var o1 = {
	a: 3
};

var o2 = {
	b: 3
};

foo( o1 );
console.log( o1.a ); // 2

foo( o2 );// it does not have an a property, no such property is created, and o2.a remains undefined.
console.log( o2.a ); // undefined
console.log( a ); // 2 -- Oops, leaked global!
```
The with statement takes an object, one which has zero or more properties, and **treats that object as if it is a wholly separate lexical scope**, and thus the object's properties are treated as lexically defined identifiers in that "scope".

> **Note**: Even though a with block treats an object like a lexical scope, a normal var declaration inside that with block will not be scoped to that with block, but instead the containing function scope.
when we used o2 as the "scope", it had no such a "identifier" in it, and so the normal rules of LHS identifier look-up (see Chapter 1) occurred.

Neither the "scope" of o2, nor the scope of foo(..), nor the global scope even, has an a identifier to be found, so when a = 2 is executed, it results in the automatic-global being created (since we're in non-strict mode).

in the pessimistic sense, most of those optimizations it would make are pointless if eval(..) or with are present, so it simply doesn't perform the optimizations at all.
Two mechanisms in JavaScript can "cheat" lexical scope: eval(..) and with. The former can modify existing lexical scope (at runtime) by evaluating a string of "code" which has one or more declarations in it. The latter essentially creates a whole new lexical scope (again, at runtime) by treating an object reference as a "scope" and that object's properties as scoped identifiers.

The downside to these mechanisms is that it defeats the Engine's ability to perform compile-time optimizations regarding scope look-up, because the Engine has to assume pessimistically that such optimizations will be invalid. Code will run slower as a result of using either feature. Don't use them.
