## Event Loop
```js
while(true) {
    const task =  getTaskFromMacrotaskQueue();
    if(task)
        executeTask(task);
    else
        sleep();
}
```

### Examples of tasks
*  `<script src="...">`loads, the task is to execute it.
* a user moves the mouse, the task is to dispatch mousemove event and execute handlers.
* the time is due for a scheduled setTimeout, the task is to run its callback.

> Attention    
> >     Rendering never happens while the engine executes a task. It doesn’t matter if the task takes a long time. Changes to the DOM are painted only after the task is complete.

 > >     If a task takes too long, the browser can’t do other tasks, such as processing user events. So after a time, it raises an alert like “Page Unresponsive”, suggesting killing the task with the whole page. That happens when there are a lot of complex calculations or a programming error leading to an infinite loop.

## Macrotasks and Microtasks
Microtasks come solely from our code. They are usually created by promises: an execution of .then/catch/finally handler becomes a microtask. Microtasks are used “under the cover” of await as well, as it’s another form of promise handling.

There’s also a special function queueMicrotask(func) that queues func for execution in the microtask queue.

> Immediately after every macrotask, the engine executes all tasks from microtask queue, prior to running any other macrotasks or rendering or anything else.

```js
setTimeout(() => alert("timeout")); // 3: macrotask

Promise.resolve()
  .then(() => alert("promise")); // 2: microtask after code exe

alert("code"); // 1: sync call
```

If we’d like to execute a function asynchronously (after the current code), but before changes are rendered or new events handled, we can schedule it with queueMicrotask.

## detailed event loop algorithm
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model

1 .Dequeue and run the oldest task from the macrotask queue (e.g. “script”).
1. Execute all microtasks:
1. While the microtask queue is not empty:
Dequeue and run the oldest microtask.
Render changes if any.
If the macrotask queue is empty, wait till a macrotask appears.
Go to step 1.
To schedule a new macrotask:

Use zero delayed setTimeout(f).
That may be used to split a big calculation-heavy task into pieces, for the browser to be able to react to user events and show progress between them.

Also, used in event handlers to schedule an action after the event is fully handled (bubbling done).

To schedule a new microtask

Use queueMicrotask(f).
Also promise handlers go through the microtask queue.
There’s no UI or network event handling between microtasks: they run immediately one after another.

So one may want to queueMicrotask to execute a function asynchronously, but within the environment state.

> For long heavy calculations that shouldn’t block the event loop, we can use [Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html).   
> That’s a way to run code in another, parallel thread.   
> Web Workers can exchange messages with the main process, but they have their own variables, and their own event loop.   
> Web Workers do not have access to DOM, so they are useful, mainly, for calculations, to use multiple CPU cores simultaneously.
