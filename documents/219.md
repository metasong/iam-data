## Event Loop
```js
while(true) {
    const task =  getTaskFromMacrotaskQueue();
    if(task)
        executeTask(task);
    else
        sleep();
}
```
### Examples of tasks
*  `<script src="...">`loads, the task is to execute it.
* a user moves the mouse, the task is to dispatch mousemove event and execute handlers.
* the time is due for a scheduled setTimeout, the task is to run its callback.
