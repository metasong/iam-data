## Event Loop
```js
while(true) {
    const task =  getTaskFromMacrotaskQueue();
    if(task)
        executeTask(task);
    else
        sleep();
}
```

### Examples of tasks
*  `<script src="...">`loads, the task is to execute it.
* a user moves the mouse, the task is to dispatch mousemove event and execute handlers.
* the time is due for a scheduled setTimeout, the task is to run its callback.

> Attention    
> >     Rendering never happens while the engine executes a task. It doesn’t matter if the task takes a long time. Changes to the DOM are painted only after the task is complete.      
>
 > >     If a task takes too long, the browser can’t do other tasks, such as processing user events. So after a time, it raises an alert like “Page Unresponsive”, suggesting killing the task with the whole page. That happens when there are a lot of complex calculations or a programming error leading to an infinite loop.
