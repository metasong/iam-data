Notes from [Angular DI](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-pattern)

The `@Injectable()` decorator identifies a service class that might require injected dependencies.

Angular module providers (@NgModule.providers) are registered with the application's root injector. unless the module is lazy loaded. Once created, a service instance lives for the life of the app and Angular injects this one service instance in every class that needs it. When you import an NgModule, Angular adds the module's service providers (the contents of its providers list) to the application root injector. When the Angular router lazy-loads a module, it creates a new injector. This injector is a child of the root application injector. An injector can add providers until it's first used. Once an injector starts creating and delivering services, its provider list is frozen; no new providers are allowed. When an applications starts, Angular first configures the root injector with the providers of all eagerly loaded NgModules before creating its first component and injecting any of the provided services. Once the application begins, the app root injector is closed to new providers. Imagine a tree of injectors; there is a single root injector and then a child injector for each lazy loaded module. The router adds all of the providers from the root injector to the child injector. When the router creates a component within the lazy-loaded context, Angular prefers service instances created from these providers to the service instances of the application root injector.
Any component created within a lazy loaded moduleâ€™s context, such as by router navigation, gets the local instance of the service, not the instance in the root application injector. Components in external modules continue to receive the instance created for the application root. So it bad if a shared module(used by other moudles) provides a service to a lazy-loaded module, there would be two service instances whitch lives in app root injector and the lazy module injector. The SharedModule should not have providers. And Consider making CoreModule a pure services module with no declarations. The AppComponent's injector is a child of the root injector, one down in the injector hierarchy. For applications that don't use the router, that's almost the entire application. But in routed applications, routing operates at the root level where AppComponent services don't exist. This means that lazy-loaded modules can't reach them.
Though you can provide services by lazy loading modules, not all services can be lazy loaded. For instance, some modules only work in the root module, such as the Router. The Router works with the global location object in the browser.

[ngModule-faq](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule-faq)

### Why is a service provided in a lazy-loaded module visible only to that module?
> Unlike providers of the modules loaded at launch, providers of lazy-loaded modules are module-scoped.
> When the Angular router lazy-loads a module, it creates a new execution context. That context has its own injector, which is a direct child of the application injector.
> The router adds the lazy module's providers and the providers of its imported NgModules to this child injector.
### What if two modules provide the same service?
> When Angular looks to inject a service for that token, it creates and delivers the instance created by the second provider.
Every class that injects this service gets the instance created by the second provider. Even classes declared within the first module get the instance created by the second provider.If NgModule A provides a service for token 'X' and imports an NgModule B that also provides a service for token 'X', then NgModule A's service definition "wins".The service provided by the root AppModule takes precedence over services provided by imported NgModules. The AppModule always wins.



These providers are insulated from changes to application providers with the same lookup token. When the router creates a component within the lazy-loaded context, Angular prefers service instances created from these providers to the service instances of the application root injector.
A component's providers (@Component.providers) are registered with each component instance's own injector. Angular can only inject the corresponding services in that component instance or one of its descendant component instances. Each new instance of the component gets its own instance of the service when the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance. roviding the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets its own, private instance of the service.

Services are singletons within the scope of an injector. There is at most one instance of a service in a given injector.  

When Angular destroys one of these component instance, it also destroys the component's injector and that injector's service instances. A component's injector is a child of its parent component's injector, and a descendent of its parent's parent's injector, and so on all the way back to the application's root injector

The @Optional decorator tells Angular to continue when it can't find the dependency. Angular sets the injection parameter to null instead.

The @Host decorator Specifies that an injector should retrieve a dependency from any injector until reaching the host element of the current component. the host component is typically the component requesting the dependency. But when this component is projected into a parent component, that parent component becomes the host. The next example covers this second case.

@SkipSelf is essential for two reasons:

* It tells the injector to start its search for a Parent dependency in a component above itself, which is what parent means.

* Angular throws a cyclic dependency error if you omit the @SkipSelf decorator. Cannot instantiate cyclic dependency! (BethComponent -> Parent -> BethComponent)
## Aliased class providers
Provider token alternatives: the class-interface(abstract class) and InjectionToken
```js
[ NewLogger,
  // Not aliased! Creates two instances of `NewLogger`, one for NewLogger and one for OldLogger
  { provide: OldLogger, useClass: NewLogger}]
```

```js
// An object in the shape of the logger service
[ NewLogger,
  // Alias OldLogger w/ reference to NewLogger, only one NewLogger instance
  { provide: OldLogger, useExisting: NewLogger}]
```

TypeScript interfaces aren't valid tokens, An interface is a TypeScript design-time artifact. JavaScript doesn't have interfaces. The TypeScript interface disappears from the generated JavaScript. There is no interface type information left for Angular to find at runtime. One solution is using InjectionToken.

## Working with injectors directly

```js 
constructor(private injector: Injector) { }

ngOnInit() {
  this.car = this.injector.get(Car);
  this.heroService = this.injector.get(HeroService);
  this.hero = this.heroService.getHeroes()[0];
}
```

## Hierarchical Dependency Injectors

When a component requests a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with a provider registered in that component's own injector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's injector. If that injector can't satisfy the request, it passes it along to its parent injector. The requests keep bubbling up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor injectors. If it runs out of ancestors, Angular throws an error.

## Inject the component's DOM element

```js
  private el: HTMLElement;

  constructor(el: ElementRef) {
    this.el = el.nativeElement;
  }

  @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {
    this.highlight(this.highlightColor || 'cyan');
  }
```

## Component Finding
There is an API for acquiring a child reference. Check out `Query`, `QueryList`, `ViewChildren`, and ContentChildren in the [API Reference](https://angular.io/api/).
You use standard class injection to acquire a parent component whose type you know.

### find parent component via class interface

```typescript
// Marker class, used as an interface
export abstract class Parent { name: string; }
@Component({
  selector: 'alex',
  template: `
    <div class="a">
      <h3>{{name}}</h3>
      <cathy></cathy>
    </div>`,
  providers: [{ provide: Parent, useExisting: forwardRef(() => AlexComponent) }],
})
// Todo: Add `... implements Parent` to class signature
export class AlexComponent extends Base
{
  name= 'Alex';
}

@Component({
  selector: 'cathy',
  template: `
  <div class="c">
    <h3>Cathy</h3>
    {{alex ? 'Found' : 'Did not find'}} Alex via the component class.<br>
  </div>`
})
export class CathyComponent {
  constructor( @Optional() public alex: AlexComponent ) { }
}
```

### Find the parent in a tree of parents with @SkipSelf()
Alice -> Barry -> Carol (Alice is parent of Barry..., Carol and Barry want to find their parrent component via class interface)
```typescript
const templateB = `
  <div class="b">
    <carol></carol>
  </div>`;

@Component({
  selector:   'barry',
  template:   templateB,
  providers:  [{ provide: Parent, useExisting: forwardRef(() => BarryComponent) }]
})
export class BarryComponent implements Parent {
  name = 'Barry';
  constructor( @SkipSelf() @Optional() public parent: Parent ) { }
}
```

## forwardRef
forwardRef is used when the token which we need to refer to for the purposes of DI is declared, but not yet defined. It is also used when the token which we use when creating a query is not yet defined. could be used to solve this problem: You're in a bind when class 'A' refers to class 'B' and 'B' refers to 'A'. One of them has to be defined first.
```typescript
class Door {
  lock: Lock;

  // Door attempts to inject Lock, despite it not being defined yet.
  // forwardRef makes this possible.
  constructor(@Inject(forwardRef(() => Lock)) lock: Lock) { this.lock = lock; }
}

// Only at this point Lock is defined.
class Lock {}

const injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([Door, Lock]);
const door = injector.get(Door);
expect(door instanceof Door).toBeTruthy();
expect(door.lock instanceof Lock).toBeTruthy();
```

 The full code can be found [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/view/provider.ts#L343).

```typescript
export function resolveDep(view: ViewData, elDef: NodeDef, allowPrivateServices: boolean, 
    depDef: DepDef, notFoundValue: any = Injector.THROW_IF_NOT_FOUND): any {
  
  const startView = view;
  const tokenKey = depDef.tokenKey;
  ...

  while (view) {
    if (elDef) {
      switch (tokenKey) {
        case RendererV1TokenKey: { ... }
        case Renderer2TokenKey: { ... }
        case ElementRefTokenKey: { ... }
        case ViewContainerRefTokenKey: { ... }
        case TemplateRefTokenKey: { ... }

              (allowPrivateServices ? elDef.element !.allProviders :
                                      elDef.element !.publicProviders) ![tokenKey];
          if (providerDef) {
            const providerData = asProviderData(view, providerDef.index);
            if (providerData.instance === NOT_CREATED) {
              providerData.instance = _createProviderInstance(view, providerDef);
            }
            return providerData.instance;
          }
      }
    }
    ...
    
    elDef = viewParentEl(view) !;
 Â  Â view = view.parent !;
/*
The while loop will continue running until the dependency is found in the ancestor injector.
*/
  }

/*
If the source component or one of its ancestor components was loaded by the Router Outlet (the router component), the root injector is the Outlet Injector. This injector supplies some dependencies like the *Router* service. Otherwise, the root injector is the bootstrap componentâ€™s injector.
 */Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
  const value = startView.root.injector.get(depDef.token, NOT_FOUND_CHECK_ONLY_ELEMENT_INJECTOR);

  if (value !== NOT_FOUND_CHECK_ONLY_ELEMENT_INJECTOR || ...) {
    return value;
  }
/*

 Â return startView.root.ngModule.injector.get(depDef.token, notFoundValue);
}

```

**Notes:**
* !. is non-null assertion operator - it just saying to type checker that you're sure that a is not null or undefined.  the operation x! produces a value of the type of x with null and undefined excluded. Similar to type assertions of the forms <T>x and x as T, the ! non-null assertion operator is simply removed in the emitted JavaScript code.
