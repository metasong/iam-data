1. directive/component created -> 
1. the directive's input property set one by one, we could handle change in the property setter just for that input property-> 
1. ngOnChanges that happens after all input properties are set and the parameter contains all the changes of inputs, we could handle changes that related to several inputs here ->
1. ngOnInit just happens the first time after ngOnChanges, means directive/component created and Input properties set, means fully initiallized ->
1. ngDoCheck: to dectect additional changes that may happens and can not detected by Angular change dectection (not from input value changes, any others?). i.e. in async pipe from the observerable 
1. afterContentInit: get notified after the first time of content's change detection: ngOnChange/ngOninit
   > content is 
1. afterContentChecked: get notified after content's additional check happened: ngDoCheck
1. then go inside the template from the element of component/directive, but content first then the template view.
1. afterViewInit: 

need to look hook sequence between the parent and child.
## Note
* afterViewInit: means the first change dection round has complete, so the @ViewChild(ren) @ContentChild(ren) queries that with static: false(default), would get its value assigned.(static: true, query and value assigned after create, that means at OnInit we could get the value)
* xxxInit means the first time of xxxcheck, xxxcheck happens very time of change detection.
