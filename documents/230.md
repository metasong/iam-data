need to look hook sequence between the parent and child.
## Note
* afterViewInit: means the first change dection round has complete, so the @ViewChild(ren) @ContentChild(ren) queries that with static: false(default), would get its value assigned.(static: true, query and value assigned after create, that means at OnInit we could get the value)
* xxxInit means the first time of xxxcheck, xxxcheck happens very time of change detection.
* directive/component created the directive's input property set
