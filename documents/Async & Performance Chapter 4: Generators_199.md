# Async & Performance Chapter 4: Generators

https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch4.md

Callback-based async doesn't fit how our brain plans out steps of a task.
Callbacks aren't trustable or composable because of inversion of control.
Promises uninvert the inversion of control of callbacks, restoring trustability/composability.Now we turn our attention to expressing async flow control in a sequential, synchronous-looking fashion.
