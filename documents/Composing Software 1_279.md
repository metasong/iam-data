# Composing Software 1

**Functional mixins** are composable factory functions which connect together in a pipeline; each function adding some properties or behaviors like workers on an assembly line. Functional mixins don’t depend on or require a base factory or constructor: Simply pass any arbitrary object into a mixin, and an enhanced version of that object will be returned.
### Functional mixin features:

* Data privacy/encapsulation
* Inheriting private state
* Inheriting from multiple sources
* No diamond problem (property collision ambiguity) — last in wins
* No base-class requirement

```js
const quacking = quack => o => Object.assign({}, o, {
  quack: () => quack
});
const flying = o => {
  let isFlying = false;
  return Object.assign({}, o, {
    fly () {
      isFlying = true;
      return this;
    },
    isFlying: () => isFlying,
    land () {
      isFlying = false;
      return this;
    }
  });
};

const pipe = (...fns) => x => fns.reduce((y, f) => f(y), x);
// OR...
// import pipe from `lodash/fp/flow`;
const createDuck = quack => pipe(
  flying,
  quacking(quack)
)({});
const duck = createDuck('Quack!');
console.log(duck.fly().quack());

```
