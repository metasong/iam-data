## Diagrams

![](https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/basic-usage.svg)
* git reset -- files copies files from the latest commit to the stage. Use this command to "undo" a git add files. 
* git checkout -- files copies files from the stage to the 
directory. Use this to throw away local changes.
* You can use git reset -p or --patch, git checkout -p, or git add -p instead of (or in addition to) specifying particular files to interactively choose which hunks copy.

The index is a mechanism for preventing what you commit from matching what you tested in your working directory

The Index is the staging area in git. It’s basically a layer that separates your working tree from the Git repository. This gives developers more power over what gets sent to the Git repository.

HEAD is a pointer that points to the current branch. A repository only has 1 active HEAD.
head is a pointer that points to any commit. A repository can have any number of heads.

This way I can checkpoint every few minutes. It’s a very cheap operation, and I don’t have to spend time cleaning up the checkpoints later. `git diff` tells me what I’ve changed since the last checkpoint; `git diff head` shows what’s changed since the last commit. `git checkout .` reverts to the last checkpoint; `git checkout head .` reverts to the last commit. And `git stash` and `git checkout -m -b` operate on the changes since the last

commit, which is what I want.
