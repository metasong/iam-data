* git reset -- files copies files from the latest commit to the stage. Use this command to "undo" a git add files. 
* git checkout -- files copies files from the stage to the 
directory. Use this to throw away local changes.
* You can use git reset -p or --patch, git checkout -p, or git add -p instead of (or in addition to) specifying particular files to interactively choose which hunks copy.

index: means files are considered  
stage: is named on file status, ready to play in 


## help
* `git help add` open online help
* `git add -h` show help in console

## file status

all the status is relevant to the index


`git add` is used to stage changes for next commit.
## workflow
![=80%x](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgaV9.png)

* `git add -u` is update tracked files, untracked file(newly added file) is not included. (update index)
* The `git add` command can be used to add ignored files with the -f (force) option
* `git add -A(-all)` adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the working tree. 

The index is a mechanism for preventing what you commit from matching what you tested in your working directory

The Index is the staging area in git. It’s basically a layer that separates your working tree from the Git repository. This gives developers more power over what gets sent to the Git repository.

HEAD is a pointer that points to the current branch. A repository only has 1 active HEAD.
head is a pointer that points to any commit. A repository can have any number of heads.

This way I can checkpoint every few minutes. It’s a very cheap operation, and I don’t have to spend time cleaning up the checkpoints later. `git diff` tells me what I’ve changed since the last checkpoint; `git diff head` shows what’s changed since the last commit. `git checkout .` reverts to the last checkpoint; `git checkout head .` reverts to the last commit. And `git stash` and `git checkout -m -b` operate on the changes since the last 
commit, which is what I want.
