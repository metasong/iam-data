callback is lack of sequentiality and lack of trustability.

once my future value was ready, I exchanged my value-promise for the value itself.
```js
function add(getX,getY,cb) {
	var x, y;
	getX( function(xVal){
		x = xVal;
		// both are ready? 
		if (y != undefined) {
			cb( x + y );	// send along sum
		}
	} );
	getY( function(yVal){
		y = yVal;
		// both are ready
		if (x != undefined) {
			cb( x + y );	// send along sum
		}
	} );
}

// `fetchX()` and `fetchY()` are sync or async
// functions
add(fetchX, fetchY, function(sum){
	console.log( sum ); // that was easy, huh?
} );
```
```js
function add(xPromise,yPromise) {
	// `Promise.all([ .. ])` takes an array of promises,
	// and returns a new promise that waits on them
	// all to finish
	return Promise.all( [xPromise, yPromise] )

	// when that promise is resolved, let's take the
	// received `X` and `Y` values and add them together.
	.then( function(values){
		// `values` is an array of the messages from the
		// previously resolved promises
		return values[0] + values[1];
	} );
}

// `fetchX()` and `fetchY()` return promises for
// their respective values, which may be ready
// *now* or *later*.
add( fetchX(), fetchY() )

// we get a promise back for the sum of those
// two numbers.
// now we chain-call `then(..)` to wait for the
// resolution of that returned promise.
.then( function(sum){
	console.log( sum ); // that was easier!
} );
```
```js
add( fetchX(), fetchY() )
.then(
	// fullfillment handler
	function(sum) {
		console.log( sum );
	},
	// rejection handler
	function(err) {
		console.error( err ); // bummer!
	}
);
```

Because Promises encapsulate the time-dependent state -- waiting on the fulfillment or rejection of the underlying value -- from the outside, the Promise itself is time-independent, and thus Promises can be composed (combined) in predictable ways regardless of the timing or outcome underneath.

Moreover, once a Promise is resolved, it stays that way forever -- it becomes an immutable value at that point -- and can then be observed as many times as necessary.
Promises are an easily repeatable mechanism for encapsulating and composing future values.

callbacks themselves represent an inversion of control. So inverting the callback pattern is actually an inversion of inversion, or an uninversion of control -- restoring control back to the calling code where we wanted it to be in the first place.


## Thenable Duck Typing
the duck typing check for a thenable:
```js
if (p !== null &&
	(
		typeof p === "object" ||
		typeof p === "function"
	) &&
	typeof p.then === "function"
) {
	// assume it's a thenable!
}
else {
	// not a thenable
}
```
### BUT
Thenable duck typing can be helpful, as we'll see later. Just beware that thenable duck typing can be hazardous if it incorrectly identifies something as a Promise that isn't.
```js
/// v is a thebable here!!!☹️
var o = { then: function(){} };

// make `v` be `[[Prototype]]`-linked to `o`
var v = Object.create( o );

v.someStuff = "cool";
v.otherStuff = "not so cool";
```

```js
/// all object and array become thenable☹️
/// if what's specified is a function that doesn't call either of its parameters as callbacks, then any Promise resolved with such a value will just silently hang forever! Crazy.😖
Object.prototype.then = function(){};
Array.prototype.then = function(){};

var v1 = { hello: "world" };
var v2 = [ "Hello", "World" ];
```
## Promise Trust
- Call the callback too early
- Call the callback too late (or never)
- Call the callback too few or too many - times
- Fail to pass along any necessary environment/parameters
- Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen
### Calling Too Early
Promises prevent Zalgo automatically.even an immediately fulfilled Promise (like `new Promise(function(resolve){ resolve(42); })`) cannot be observed synchronously.when you call then(..) on a Promise, even if that Promise was already resolved, the callback you provide to then(..) will always be called asynchronously

## Calling Too Late

when a Promise is resolved, all then(..) registered callbacks on it will be called, in order, immediately at the next asynchronous opportunity, and nothing that happens inside of one of those callbacks can affect/delay the calling of the other callbacks.

```js
p.then( function(){
	p.then( function(){
		console.log( "C" );
	} );
	console.log( "A" );
} );
p.then( function(){
	console.log( "B" );
} );
// A B C

```

but you should never rely on anything about the ordering/scheduling of callbacks across Promises. 

```js
var p3 = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	resolve( "B" );
} );

var p1 = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	resolve( p3 );
} );

var p2 = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	resolve( "A" );
} );

p1.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );
} );

p2.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );
} );

// A B  <-- not  B A  as you might expect

```

### Never Calling the Callback

First, nothing (not even a JS error) can prevent a Promise from notifying you of its resolution (if it's resolved). If you register both fulfillment and rejection callbacks for a Promise, and the Promise gets resolved, one of the two callbacks will always be called.
But what if the Promise itself never gets resolved either way? Even that is a condition that Promises provide an answer for, using a higher level abstraction called a "race":
```js
// a utility for timing out a Promise
function timeoutPromise(delay) {
	return new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
		setTimeout( function(){
			reject( "Timeout!" );
		}, delay );
	} );
}

// setup a timeout for `foo()`
Promise.race( [
	foo(),					// attempt `foo()`
	timeoutPromise( 3000 )	// give it 3 seconds
] )
.then(
	function(){
		// `foo(..)` fulfilled in time!
	},
	function(err){
		// either `foo()` rejected, or it just
		// didn't finish in time, so inspect
		// `err` to know which
	}
);
```
### Calling Too Few or Too Many Times

If for some reason the Promise creation code tries to call resolve(..) or reject(..) multiple times, or tries to call both, the Promise will accept only the first resolution, and will silently ignore any subsequent attempts.any then(..) registered callbacks will only ever be called once (each).
### Failing to Pass Along Any Parameters/Environment
If you call resolve(..) or reject(..) with multiple parameters, all subsequent parameters beyond the first will be silently ignored.
### Swallowing Any Errors/Exceptions
```js
var p = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	foo.bar();	// `foo` is not defined, so error!
	resolve( 42 );	// never gets here :(
} );

p.then(
	function fulfilled(){
		// never gets here :(
	},
	function rejected(err){
		// `err` will be a `TypeError` exception object
		// from the `foo.bar()` line.
	}
);
```
This is an important detail, because it effectively solves another potential Zalgo moment, which is that errors could create a synchronous reaction whereas nonerrors would be asynchronous. Promises turn even JS exceptions into asynchronous behavior, thereby reducing the race condition chances greatly.
```js
var p = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	resolve( 42 );
} );

p.then(
	function fulfilled(msg){
		foo.bar();
		console.log( msg );	// never gets here :(
	},
	function rejected(err){
		// never gets here either :(
	}
);
```
The p.then(..) call itself returns another promise, and it's that promise that will be rejected with the TypeError exception.
### Trustable Promise?

```js
var p1 = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	resolve( 42 );
} );

var p2 = Promise.resolve( 42 );

// p2 !==p1

// if you pass a non-Promise thenable value to Promise.resolve(..),
// it will attempt to unwrap that value
var p1 = Promise.resolve( 42 );

var p2 = Promise.resolve( p1 );

p1 === p2; // true

```

```js
var p = {
	then: function(cb) {
		cb( 42 );
	}
};

// this works OK, but only by good fortune
p
.then(
	function fulfilled(val){
		console.log( val ); // 42
	},
	function rejected(err){
		// never gets here
	}
);
```
```js
😩
var p = {
	then: function(cb,errcb) {
		cb( 42 );
		errcb( "evil laugh" );
	}
};

p
.then(
	function fulfilled(val){
		console.log( val ); // 42
	},
	function rejected(err){
		// oops, shouldn't have run
		console.log( err ); // evil laugh
	}
);
```
**it's not trustable as is.BUT:**
```js
Promise.resolve( p )
// either of these versions of p, 
// you get back from Promise.resolve(..) a real, 
// genuine Promise in its place, one that you can trust.
.then(
	function fulfilled(val){
		console.log( val ); // 42
	},
	function rejected(err){
		// never gets here
	}
);
```
```js
// don't just do this:
foo( 42 )
.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );
} );

// instead, do this:
Promise.resolve( foo( 42 ) )
.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );
} );
```
this also normalize that function call into a well-behaving *async *task. If foo(42) returns an immediate value sometimes, or a Promise other times, `Promise.resolve( foo(42) ) `makes sure it's always a Promise result.

## Chain Flow

* A then(..) call against one Promise automatically produces a new Promise to return from the call.
* Inside the fulfillment/rejection handlers, if you return a value or an exception is thrown, the new returned (chainable) Promise is resolved accordingly.
* If the fulfillment or rejection handler returns a Promise, it is unwrapped, so that whatever its resolution is will become the resolution of the chained Promise returned from the current then(..).
```js
var p = Promise.resolve( 21 );

var p2 = p.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );	// 21

	// fulfill `p2` with value `42`
	return v * 2;
} );

// chain off `p2`
p2.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );	// 42
} );
```
```js
var p = Promise.resolve( 21 );

p.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );	// 21

	// create a promise to return
	return new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
		// introduce asynchrony!
		setTimeout( function(){
			// fulfill with value `42`
			resolve( v * 2 );
		}, 100 );
	} );
} )
.then( function(v){
	// runs after the 100ms delay in the previous step
	console.log( v );	// 42
} );
```

```js
// assume an `ajax( {url}, {callback} )` utility

// Promise-aware ajax
function request(url) {
	return new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
		// the `ajax(..)` callback should be our
		// promise's `resolve(..)` function
		ajax( url, resolve );
	} );
}

request( "http://some.url.1/" )
.then( function(response1){
	return request( "http://some.url.2/?v=" + response1 );
} )
.then( function(response2){
	console.log( response2 );
} );
```

```js
// step 1:
request( "http://some.url.1/" )

// step 2:
.then( function(response1){
	foo.bar(); // undefined, error!

	// never gets here
	return request( "http://some.url.2/?v=" + response1 );
} )

// step 3:
.then(
	function fulfilled(response2){
		// never gets here
	},
	// rejection handler to catch the error
	function rejected(err){
		console.log( err );	// `TypeError` from `foo.bar()` error
		return 42;
	}
)

// step 4:
.then( function(msg){
	console.log( msg );		// 42
} );
```


```js
var p = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	reject( "Oops" );
} );

var p2 = p.then(
	function fulfilled(){
		// never gets here
	}
	// assumed rejection handler, if omitted or
	// any other non-function value passed
	// function(err) {
	//     throw err;
	// }
);

var p = Promise.resolve( 42 );

p.then(
	// assumed fulfillment handler, if omitted or
	// any other non-function value passed
	// function(v) {
	//     return v;
	// }
	null,
	function rejected(err){
		// never gets here
	}
);
```

### Terminology: Resolve, Fulfill, and Reject
```js
var rejectedTh = {
	then: function(resolved,rejected) {
		rejected( "Oops" );
	}
};

var rejectedPr = Promise.resolve( rejectedTh );
```
So Promise.resolve(..) is a good, accurate name for the API method, because it can actually result in either fulfillment or rejection.
```js
var rejectedPr = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	// resolve this promise with a rejected promise
	resolve( Promise.reject( "Oops" ) );
} );

rejectedPr.then(
	function fulfilled(){
		// never gets here
	},
	function rejected(err){
		console.log( err );	// "Oops"
	}
);
```
resolve(..) is the appropriate name for the first callback parameter of the Promise(..) constructor.



The previously mentioned reject(..) does not do the unwrapping that resolve(..) does. If you pass a Promise/thenable value to reject(..), that untouched value will be set as the rejection reason. A subsequent rejection handler would receive the actual Promise/thenable you passed to reject(..), not its underlying immediate value.


## Error Handling

```js
function foo() {
	setTimeout( function(){
		baz.bar();
	}, 100 );
}

try {
	foo();
	// later throws global error from `baz.bar()`
}
catch (err) {
	// never gets here
}
```
`try..catch` would certainly be nice to have, but it doesn't work across async operations.belowisasolution, but is perils of callback hell 
```js
function foo(cb) {
	setTimeout( function(){
		try {
			var x = baz.bar();
			cb( null, x ); // success!
		}
		catch (err) {
			cb( err );
		}
	}, 100 );
}

foo( function(err,val){
	if (err) {
		console.error( err ); // bummer :(
	}
	else {
		console.log( val );
	}
} );

```

```js
var p = Promise.resolve( 42 );

p.then(
	function fulfilled(msg){
		// numbers don't have string functions,
		// so will throw an error
		console.log( msg.toLowerCase() );
	},
	function rejected(err){
		// never gets here
	}
);
```
why doesn't our error handler get notified? As we explained earlier, it's because that error handler is for the p promise, which has already been fulfilled with value 42. The p promise is immutable, so the only promise that can be notified of the error is the one returned from p.then(..), which in this case we don't capture.

**Warning**: If you use the Promise API in an invalid way and an error occurs that prevents proper Promise construction, the result will be an immediately thrown exception, not a rejected Promise. Some examples of incorrect usage that fail Promise construction: `new Promise(null), Promise.all(), Promise.race(42)`, and so on. You can't get a rejected Promise if you don't use the Promise API validly enough to actually construct a Promise in the first place!

### Pit of Despair

Jeff Atwood noted years ago: programming languages are often set up in such a way that by default, developers fall into the "pit of despair" (http://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/) -- where accidents are punished -- and that you have to try harder to get it right. He implored us to instead create a "pit of success," where by default you fall into expected (successful) action, and thus would have to try hard to fail.

Promise error handling is unquestionably "pit of despair" design. By default, it assumes that you want any error to be swallowed by the Promise state, and if you forget to observe that state, the error silently languishes/dies in obscurity -- usually despair.

```js
var p = Promise.resolve( 42 );

p.then(
	function fulfilled(msg){
		// numbers don't have string functions,
		// so will throw an error
		console.log( msg.toLowerCase() );
	}
)
/// handled here!
.catch( handleErrors );
```
What happens if handleErrors(..) itself also has an error in it? Who catches that? You can't just stick another catch(..) on the end of that chain, because it too could fail. 

#### solutions for unhandled this problem
Some Promise libraries have added methods for registering something like a "global unhandled rejection" handler, their solution for how to identify an error as "uncaught" is to have an arbitrary-length timer, say 3 seconds, running from time of rejection. If a Promise is rejected but no error handler is registered before the timer fires, then it's assumed that you won't ever be registering a handler, so it's "uncaught."
Another more common suggestion is that Promises should have a done(..) added to them, which essentially marks the Promise chain as "done." done(..) doesn't create and return a Promise
```js
var p = Promise.resolve( 42 );

p.then(
	function fulfilled(msg){
		// numbers don't have string functions,
		// so will throw an error
		console.log( msg.toLowerCase() );
	}
)
.done( null, handleErrors );

// if `handleErrors(..)` caused its own exception, it would
// be thrown globally here (in the developer console, basically)
```
But the biggest problem is that it's not part of the ES6 standard

good news is browsers have a unique capability that our code does not have: they can track and know for sure when any object gets thrown away and garbage collected. So, browsers can track Promise objects, and whenever they get garbage collected, if they have a rejection in them, the browser knows for sure this was a legitimate "uncaught error," and can thus confidently know it should report it to the developer console.

### future Pit of Success design

* Promises could default to reporting (to the developer console) any rejection, on the next Job or event loop tick, if at that exact moment no error handler has been registered for the Promise.
* For the cases where you want a rejected Promise to hold onto its rejected state for an indefinite amount of time before observing, you could call defer(), which suppresses automatic error reporting on that Promise.

```js
var p = Promise.reject( "Oops" ).defer();

// `foo(..)` is Promise-aware
foo( 42 )
.then(
	function fulfilled(){
		return p;
	},
	function rejected(err){
		// handle `foo(..)` error
	}
);
...
```
the promise returned from the then(..) call has no defer() or error handler attached, so if it rejects (from inside either resolution handler), then it will be reported to the developer console as an uncaught error.
