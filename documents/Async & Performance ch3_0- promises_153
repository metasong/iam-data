## Promise API

### new Promise(..) Constructor
```js
var p = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	// `resolve(..)` to resolve/fulfill the promise
	// `reject(..)` to reject the promise
} );


```
reject(..) simply rejects the promise, but resolve(..) can either fulfill the promise or reject it, depending on what it's passed. If resolve(..) is passed an immediate, non-Promise, non-thenable value, then the promise is fulfilled with that value.
