## Promise API

### new Promise(..) Constructor
```js
var p = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	// `resolve(..)` to resolve/fulfill the promise
	// `reject(..)` to reject the promise
} );


```
reject(..) simply rejects the promise, but resolve(..) can either fulfill the promise or reject it, depending on what it's passed. If resolve(..) is passed an immediate, non-Promise, non-thenable value, then the promise is fulfilled with that value. But if resolve(..) is passed a genuine Promise or thenable value, that value is unwrapped recursively, and whatever its final resolution/state is will be adopted by the promise.

A shortcut for creating an already-rejected Promise is `Promise.reject(..)`
, so these two promises are equivalent:

```js
var p1 = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	reject( "Oops" );
} );

var p2 = Promise.reject( "Oops" );
```
