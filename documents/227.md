## Magic Square
> An NxN matrix of numbers which sum to the same value across each row, down each column, and through each diagonal, is said to be a magic square of order N.   

### Given: 
An NxN matrix of numbers, Determine whether the input is a magic square.  If so, return the magic sum.      
Otherwise:     
If the matrix can be made into a magic square by swapping the values in exactly two cells, return the values in the cells which must be swapped, least value first.   
Otherwise, return NOT A MAGIC SQUARE
