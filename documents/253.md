# Iam Execute Context Script Problem

## Problem

    <script >
      alert("Hello World!");
      console.warn('ddd__')
    </script>

the script directly included in markdown could not be executed, but if goto https://markdown-it.github.io/, and enable `html`, it could be executed.

## Root Cause
`Iam` assign the html string to  `parent.innerHtml` to renter the output, it would not execute the script:
