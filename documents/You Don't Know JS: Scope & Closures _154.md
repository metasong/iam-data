* Engine: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JavaScript program.

* Compiler: one of Engine's friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation (see previous section).

* Scope: another friend of Engine; collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.
