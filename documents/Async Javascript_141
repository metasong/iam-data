# Async Javascript
*summery*
Concurrency is when two or more "processes" are executing simultaneously over the same period, regardless of whether their individual constituent operations happen in parallel (at the same instant on separate processors or cores) or not. You can think of concurrency then as "process"-level (or task-level) parallelism, as opposed to operation-level parallelism (separate-processor threads).
More commonly, concurrent "processes" will by necessity interact
```js
var res = [];

function response(data) {
	if (data.url == "http://some.url.1") {
		res[0] = data;
	}
	else if (data.url == "http://some.url.2") {
		res[1] = data;
	}
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```
