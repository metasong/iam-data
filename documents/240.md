Unlike the strict equality operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.

The equality operators (== and !=) use the [Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3) to compare two operands. This can be roughly summarised as follows:

* If the operands are both objects, return true only if both operands reference the same object.
    > object compared by reference
* If one operand is null or the other is undefined, return true.
    > undefined == null
* If the operands are of different types, try to convert them to the same type before comparing:
    * When comparing a number to a string, try to convert the string to a numeric value.
        > compared by number: '1' == 1 -> true
    * If one of the operands is a boolean, convert the boolean operand to 1 if it is true and +0 if it is false.
        > boolean is always converted to number
    * If one of the operands is an object and the other is a number or a string, try to convert the object to a primitive using the object's valueOf() or toString() methods.
    > object to primative, then compare
* If the operands have the same type, they are compared as follows:
    * String: return true only if both operands have the same characters in the same order.
    > 'a' !='A'
    * Number: return true only if both operands have the same value. +0 and -0 are treated as the same value. If either operand is NaN, return false.
    * Boolean: return true only if operands are both true or both false.
    
> The most notable difference between this operator and the strict equality (===) operator is that the strict equality operator does not attempt type conversion. Instead, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.
```js
false == [] // true
// false -> +0; [] => 0

false == ![] // true
// ![] => false

[] == ![]
```

```js
1 == '1' // string to number when compared with number
undefined == null
// boolean always to number
0 == false 
1 == true 
2 != true
0 == !!null // !!null -> false -> 0
var a =  new Number(1);
1 == a // object -> primative -> Number.__proto__.valueOf return 1
a.__proto__.valueOf.bind(a)() //-> 1, Number.__proto__.valueOf
a.__proto__.__proto__.valueOf.bind(a)() //-> a, Object.__proto__.valueOf -> this
a != new Number(1) // object compared by reference
a == Number(1) // obj to number
'1'==new Number(1) //obj to string
({}!={}) 
// string
const str = 'hello'
cosnt str1 = String('hello')
const strObj = new String('hello')
const strObj1 = new String('hello')
str == str1
str == strObj
strObj == str1
strObj != strObj1
// Date
d = new Date()
dStr = d.toString();
dStr1 = Date(dstr)
d == dStr // obj to primative, toPrimative(hint) Date object hint is string, d.__proto__.toString(). note: new Date().valueOf() return integer of current timestamp
d == dStr1
v = d.valueOf()
v!=d
```
