## plan
1. v1: a self boot one in C that can generate C code
    1. minimal featues (simple c features):
        * var, expression, structural type, enum, sequence block, function, if and for block
1. evolve on V1 

### self boot
v0.1: run expression: s => compiler in C.exe => run s and generate c99
v0.2: support type
v0.3: support function
v0.4: support if and loop
translate S compiler in c in to s; compile it into c codes, and compile in to exe

s => compiler in S.exe => run s
