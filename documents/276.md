## [Introduction](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/composing-software-an-introduction-27b72500d6ea)
> Composition: “The act of combining parts or elements to form a whole.” ~ *Dictionary.com*

## Three kinds of function composition

* embedded function call: f(g(h(j(a))))
* method chaining: a.f().g().h()
* function piping or combining:    
   pipe(z,x,c)(a)

Function composition is the process of passing the return value of one function as an argument to another function. In mathematical notation:

`(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x))`

We can call this kind of function composition as embedded function composition, it's not friendly to read or write.

Method chaining is the process of directly calling a method on the return value of a function, without needing to refer to the return value by name:

```js {10}
const g = n => n + 1;
const f = n => n * 2;
const wait = time => new Promise(
  (resolve, reject) => setTimeout(
    resolve,
    time
  )
);
wait(300)
  .then(() => 20)
  .then(g)
  .then(f)
  .then(value => console.log(value)) // 42
;
```

> If you’re chaining, you’re composing.

## Higher Order Functions 

> A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.

### Reduce

```js
const reduce = (reducer, initial, arr) => {
  // shared stuff
  let acc = initial;
  for (let i = 0, { length } = arr; i < length; i++) {
    // unique stuff in reducer() call
    acc = reducer(acc, arr[i], i, arr);
  // more shared stuff
  }
  return acc;
};
reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0, [1,2,3]); // 6
```
```js
const filter = (
  fn, arr
) => reduce((acc, curr) => fn(curr) ?
  acc.concat([curr]) :
  acc, [], arr
);
```

```js
const map = (fn, arr) => arr.reduce((acc, item, index, arr) => {
  return acc.concat(fn(item, index, arr));
}, []);
```

```js
const compose = (...fns) => x => fns.reduceRight((v, f) => f(v), x);
```
> Note: pipe is from left to right

### Step function 
```js
// 2 step function
const trace = label => value => {
  console.log(`${ label }: ${ value }`);
  return value;
};

trace('your name:')('jason')
/*
your name: jason
*/
```
```js
// pipe(...fns: [...Function]) => x => y
const pipe = (...fns) => x => fns.reduce((y, f) => f(y), x);
add=x=>x+1
x=>x+1
// Function composition using point-free style creates very concise, readable code, but it can come at the cost of easy debugging. 
traceAdd=trace('Add');
pipe(add,traceAdd,add,traceAdd,add)(4)
//7
```

## Currying
https://javascript.info/currying-partials
```js
function curry(f) { // curry(f) does the currying transform
  return function(a) {
    return function(b) {
      return f(a, b);
    };
  };
}

// usage
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let curriedSum = curry(sum);

alert( curriedSum(1)(2) ); // 3
```
> **Currying**: A curried 
function is a function that takes multiple parameters one at a time: It takes a parameter, and returns a function that takes the next parameter, and so on until all parameters have been supplied, at which point, the application is completed and the final value is returned.

>
`partial application` is a function which has already been applied to some — but not yet all — of its arguments. The arguments which the function has already been applied to are called `fixed parameters`

> Curried functions are great for function composition, because they allow you to easily convert
an n-ary function into the unary function form needed for function composition pipelines: Functions
in a pipeline must expect exactly one argument.

```js
// Tiny, recursive autocurry

// version 1:
const currying = 
(f, ...a) => (...args)=> {
    args = [...a,...args];
    if(args.length === f.length) return f(...args);
    return currying(f,...args);
}

// version 2: replace statments body with expression, and IIFE parameter to store local variable args
const curry =
 (f, ...arr) => (...args) => (
  (...a) => a.length === f.length ?
    f(...a) :
    curry(f, a)
)(...[...arr, ...args]);

// version 3: remove IIFE, and move local variable args into using place
const curryIt =
 (f, ...arr) => (...args) => 
   arr.length+args.length === f.length ?
    f(...[...arr, ...args]) :
    curryIt(f, ...[...arr, ...args])

```
```js
const add3 = curry((a, b, c) => a + b + c);

add3(1, 2, 3); // 6
add3(1, 2)(3); // 6
add3(1)(2, 3); // 6
add3(1)(2)(3); // 6
```
auto currying could be used to generate the pipable funtion. 

> Fixed-length functions only:   
    The currying requires the function to have a fixed number of arguments.   
    A function that uses rest parameters, such as `f(...args)`, can’t be curried this way.  because `f.length === 0`

> when writing function with muti parameters, it would be better to make the main processed object the last parameter. 

if not, in pipe step, you may have to do:
```js
pipe(
  // not point free
 x=> step(x)('last para')
  //...
  )
// flip utility
const flip = fn => a => b => fn(b)(a);
pipe(
  // point free function creating
  flip(step)('previous last para')
)
```

> Data last functions are convenient for function composition, because they can be easily used in point free style


to turn the method(`split`) on object to the pure function:
```js
const str = 'abc def';
const atrA = str.split(' ');

let split = (seprator, str/*last*/) =>
str.split(seprator)
// currying
split = curring(split);

const strB = pipe(split(' '))(str)

trace('strA === strB')(strA ===strB)
```

> Writing functions without mention of the arguments is called **point-free style**. To do it, you'll call a function that returns the new function, rather than declaring the function explicitly. That means you won't need the `function` keyword or the arrow syntax (`=>`). in a word, function is created via composition not from defination. 

[point-free-style](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/944446/what-is-point-free-style-in-functional-programming)

```js
const firstChar = x => x[0];
const toUpperCase = x => x.toUperCase();
// not pointfree cause we created a *function* that receive args
var initials = function(name) {
  // OO programming: String -> Array -> String
  return name.split(' ').map(compose(toUpperCase, firstChar)).join('. ');
};

const split = sep => str => str.split(sep);
// turn obj method into curried function (obj as last parameter)
const map = func => arr => arr.map(func);
const join = conn => strArr => strArr.join(conn);
//pointfree via composition 
var initials = compose(join('. '), map(compose(toUpperCase, firstChar)), split(' '));

initials("I'm writting your professional life");
// 'I. W. Y. P. L'
```

## Favor object composition over class inheritance
* **The tight coupling problem**: Because child classes are dependent on the implementation of the parent class, class *inheritance* is the tightest coupling available in object oriented design.
* **The fragile base class problem**: Due to tight coupling, changes to the *base* class can potentially break a large number of descendant classes — potentially in code managed by third parties. The author could break code they’re not aware of.
* **The inflexible hierarchy problem**: With single ancestor taxonomies, given enough time and evolution, all class taxonomies are eventually wrong for new use-cases.
* **The duplication by necessity problem**: Due to inflexible hierarchies, new use cases are often implemented by duplication, rather than extension, leading to similar classes which are unexpectedly divergent. Once duplication sets in, it’s not obvious which class new classes should descend from, or why.
* **The gorilla/banana problem**: “…the problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.” ~ Joe Armstrong, “Coders at Work”

### A Word on Redux

```js
reducer: (state: Any, action: { type: String, payload: Any}) => newState: Any
```

* A reducer called with no parameters should return its valid initial state.
* If the reducer isn’t going to handle the action type, it still needs to return the state.
* Redux reducers must be pure functions.

redux reducers reduce on actions by time

## [Functors & Categories](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/functors-categories-61e031bac53f)

https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#functor

A **functor** data type is something you can map over. It’s a container which has an interface which can be used to apply a function to the values inside it. When you see a functor, you should think “*mappable*”. Functor types are typically represented as an object with a .map() method that maps from inputs to outputs while preserving structure. In practice, “preserving structure” means that the return value is the same type of functor (though values inside the container may be a different type). i.e. Array- >Array 

JavaScript’s built in array and promise objects act like functors. For collections (arrays, streams, etc…), .map() typically iterates over the collection and applies the given function to each value in the collection, but not all functors iterate. Functors are really about applying a function in a specific context.

Promises use the name .then() instead of .map(). You can usually think of .then() as an asynchronous .map()method, except when you have a nested promise, in which case it automatically unwraps the outer promise. Again, for values which are not promises, .then() acts like an asynchronous .map(). For values which are promises themselves, .then()acts like the .chain() method from monads (sometimes also called .bind() or .flatMap()). So, promises are not quite functors, and not quite monads, but in practice, you can usually treat them as either. 

Categories have two important properties:

* Identity
* Composition

Since a functor is a mapping between categories, functors must respect identity and composition. Together, they’re known as the functor laws.


```js
const Identity = value => ({
  map: fn => Identity(fn(value)),
  // to + str or num
  valueOf: () => value,
  // inspect an Identity instance in the console
  toString: () => `Identity(${value})`,
  constructor: Identity,
  [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
    yield value;
  }
});

Object.assign(Identity, {
  toString: () => 'Identity',
  is: x => typeof x.map === 'function'
});
```
```js
// trace() is a utility to let you easily inspect
// the contents.
const trace = x => {
  console.log(x);
  return x;
};
const u = Identity(2);
// Identity law
u.map(trace);             // 2
u.map(x => x).map(trace); // 2
const f = n => n + 1;
const g = n => n * 2;
// Composition law
const r1 = u.map(x => f(g(x)));
const r2 = u.map(g).map(f);
r1.map(trace); // 5
r2.map(trace); // 5

// +
const ints = (Identity(2) + Identity(4));
trace(ints); // 6
const hi = (Identity('h') + Identity('i'));
trace(hi); // "hi"

// [Symbol.iterator] enables standard JS iterations:
const arr = [6, 7, ...Identity(8)];
trace(arr); // [6, 7, 8]
```
```js
const fRange = (
  start,
  end
) => Array.from(
  { length: end - start + 1 },
  
  // change `Identity` to `start.constructor`
  (x, i) => start.constructor(i + start)
);
const range = fRange(Identity(2), 4);
range.map(x => x.map(trace)); // 2, 3, 4
```

```js
// Using an arrow function as the map function to
// manipulate the elements
Array.from([1, 2, 3], x => x + x);      
// [2, 4, 6]


// Generate a sequence of numbers
// Since the array is initialized with `undefined` on each position,
// the value of `v` below will be `undefined`
Array.from({length: 5}, (v, i) => i);
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
```js
// Create the if Exists functor: kick off a chain of operations, but only if the value inside the functor is not undefined or null?
const exists = x => (x.valueOf() !== undefined && x.valueOf() !== null);
const ifExists = x => ({
  map: fn => exists(x) ? x.map(fn) : x
});
const add1 = n => n + 1;
const double = n => n * 2;
// Nothing happens...
ifExists(Identity(undefined)).map(trace);
// Still nothing...
ifExists(Identity(null)).map(trace);
// 42
ifExists(Identity(20))
  .map(add1)
  .map(double)
  .map(trace)
;
```
functional programming is all about composing tiny functions to create higher level abstractions. What if you want a generic map that works with any functor? That way you can partially apply arguments to create new functions.
```js
const curry = (
  f, arr = []
) => (...args) => (
  a => a.length === f.length ?
    f(...a) :
    curry(f, a)
)([...arr, ...args]);

const map = curry((fn, F) => F.map(fn));
const double = n => n * 2;
const mdouble = map(double);
mdouble(Identity(4)).map(trace); // 8
```
