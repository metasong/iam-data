# Async & Performanc-CALLBACKS
*summery*
```js
listen( "click", function handler(evt){
	setTimeout( function request(){
		ajax( "http://some.url.1", function response(text){
			if (text == "hello") {
				handler();
			}
			else if (text == "world") {
				request();
			}
		} );
	}, 500) ;
} );
```
That is what "**callback hell**" is all about! The nesting/indentation are basically a side show, a red herring.

And as if all that's not enough, we haven't even touched what happens when two or more chains of these callback continuations are happening simultaneously, or when the third step branches out into "parallel" callbacks with gates or latches, or... OMG, my brain hurts, how about yours!?

Are you catching the notion here that **our sequential, blocking brain planning behaviors just don't map well onto callback-oriented async code**? That's the first major deficiency to articulate about callbacks: they express asynchrony in code in ways our brains have to fight just to keep in sync with (pun intended!).

## Trust Issues

```js
analytics.trackPurchase( purchaseData, function(){
	chargeCreditCard();
	displayThankyouPage();
} );
```
called several times in new version of *analytics*.

```js
var tracked = false;

analytics.trackPurchase( purchaseData, function(){
	if (!tracked) {
		tracked = true;
		chargeCreditCard();
		displayThankyouPage();
	}
} );
```
