> Parameter decorator on a view-provider parameter of a class constructor that tells the DI framework to resolve the view by checking injectors of child elements, and stop when reaching the host element of the current component.

* host means hostTemplate, that's the template where the component/directive is used.
* host component: the component whose template i'm in.
* the parent component: the component whose content is me.
* in template there is a tree-like structure of element-injectors

[host directive test](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-aeuedh)

## Parent component and Host component for component/directive with @Host Decorator in constructor
```html
    <div class="box">
      <p>AppComponent => {{ randomNo }}</p>
      <my-child>
        <my-grandChild></my-grandChild>
      </my-child>
    </div

```
host would look for:
1. Providers/viewProviders of self.
1. Providers of it's parent(i'm the content of the parent component), in viewProviders not work, in parent sibling's viewProviders/providers not work
1. ViewProviders of AppComponent, in providers not work

## Parent directive and Host component for component/directive with @Host Decorator in constructor
```html
    <div class="box">
      <p>ChildComponent => {{ randomNo }}</p>
 
      <div aDir>
        <div bDir>
          <div cDir></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
```
1. Providers/viewProviders of self.
1. Providers of it's parent (i'm the content of the parent component), in viewProviders not work, in parent sibling's viewProviders/providers not work
1. ViewProviders of AppComponent, in providers not work
