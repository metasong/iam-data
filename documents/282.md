> Parameter decorator on a view-provider parameter of a class constructor that tells the DI framework to resolve the view by checking injectors of child elements, and stop when reaching the host element of the current component.

* host means hostTemplate, that's the template where the component/directive is used.
* host component: the component whose template i'm in.
* in template there is a tree-like structure of element-injectors
* the parent component: the component whose content is me.

[host directive test](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-aeuedh)

## Content Projection & @Host Decorator
```html
    <div class="box">
      <p>AppComponent => {{ randomNo }}</p>
      <my-child>
        <my-grandChild></my-grandChild>
      </my-child>
    </div

```
host would look for:
1. Providers/viewProviders of self.
1. Providers of it's parent(i'm the content of the parent component), in viewProviders not work, in parent sibling's viewProviders/providers not work
1. ViewProviders of AppComponent, in providers not work
