> @Host(): Parameter decorator on a view-provider(component/directive) parameter of a class constructor that tells the DI framework to resolve the view by checking injectors of the host template's child elements, start from it's element and stop when reaching the host element of the current component. (one path of element tree in host's template from its own element to the host's element)

> the function

* host means hostTemplate, that's the template where the component/directive is used.
* host component: the component whose template i'm in.
* the parent component: the component whose direct content is me.
* the parent directive: the directive which applied on the parent element
* in template there is a tree-like structure of element-injectors
* directive only has providers do not has viewProviders

[host directive test](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-aeuedh)

## Parent component and Host component for component/directive with @Host Decorator in constructor
```html
    <div class="box">
      <p>AppComponent => {{ randomNo }}</p>
      <my-child>
        <my-grandChild></my-grandChild>
      </my-child>
    </div

```

## Parent directive and Host component for component/directive with @Host Decorator in constructor
```html
    <div class="box">
      <p>ChildComponent => {{ randomNo }}</p>
 
      <div aDir>
        <div bDir>
          <div cDir></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
```
```js
export class GrandChildComponent {
  randomNo;
  constructor(
    @Host() public service1: Service1, // from self's providers or viewProviders

    @Host() private randomService: RandomService, // from parent component's providers, i'm the content of the child-component
    @Host() private service4: Service4, // from parent directive's providers

    @Host() public service2: Service2, // from host component viewProviders
    @Host() public cmp: ParentComponent, // get the host component

    @Host() public service3: Service3
  ) {
    this.randomNo = randomService?.RandomNo;
  }
}

@Directive({ selector: '[test]',
providers: [Service1], })
export class TestDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef,
    @Host() public service1: Service1, // from self's providers

    @Host() private service4: Service4, // from parent directive's providers
    @Host() private service5: Service5, // from parent component's providers

    @Host() public service2: Service2, // from host component viewProviders
    @Host() public cmp: ParentComponent, // get the host component
    ) {

  }
  ngOnInit() {
    this.el.nativeElement.innerHTML =
      "Directive =>" + this.service4.info;
  }
}

```
1. Providers/viewProviders of self. ( directive only have providers)
1. Providers of it's parent component/directive, in parent component's viewProviders not work, in parent sibling's viewProviders/providers not work
1. ViewProviders of host, in providers not work
1. could look for host component by it's class name
## Example
```js
@Directive({
    selector: 'form',
    providers: [
        {
            provide: ControlContainer,
            useExisting: NgForm
        }
    ]
})
export class NgForm {}

@Directive({
    selector: '[ngModel]',
})
export class NgModel {
    constructor(@Optional() @Host() parent: ControlContainer) {}
    private _setUpControl(): void {
        ...
        this.parent.formDirective.addControl(this);
    }
}
```
> would find the ControlContainer from it's parent directive

```js
@Directive({selector: '[ngSwitchCase]'})
export class NgSwitchCase implements DoCheck {
  private _view: SwitchView;
  /**
   * Stores the HTML template to be selected on match.
   */
  @Input() ngSwitchCase: any;

  constructor(
      viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef<Object>,
      @Optional() @Host() private ngSwitch: NgSwitch) {
    if ((typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode) && !ngSwitch) {
      throwNgSwitchProviderNotFoundError('ngSwitchCase', 'NgSwitchCase');
    }

    ngSwitch._addCase();
    this._view = new SwitchView(viewContainer, templateRef);
  }

  /**
   * Performs case matching. not use ngOnChange because of need to eveluate experience on ngSwitch too. 
   * we need to compare the result from 2 expressions.
   * in _matchCase: after all matches tested but still no match, use the default case.
   */
  ngDoCheck() {
    this._view.enforceState(this.ngSwitch._matchCase(this.ngSwitchCase));
  }
}

```
> would find ngSwitch from the ancestor directive
